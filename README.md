Day 1

🥶 Cold Water After Meals Slows Digestion? Let’s Break the Ice.
Imagine your stomach as a busy kitchen. 🍽️
Chefs (aka digestive enzymes) are working at full speed, fire blazing, breaking down that biryani you just ate.

Now suddenly-----BOOM! ❄️
You pour a glass of ice-cold water over the scene.

The flames sizzle.
The kitchen slows down.
Chefs pause, shiver a little, then reluctantly get back to work. 😅

That’s kind of what happens when you drink cold water immediately after meals.

Day 4

🦷❤️ Did you know your oral health can affect your heart?

Gum disease isn’t just about your teeth. It is linked to your heart as well..
Here's how- Studies show that it causes inflammation which can enter your bloodstream and contribute to plaque buildup in your arteries. Over time, this raises the risk of serious heart conditions like heart disease and stroke. 😧

The good news? A healthy smile can help protect your heart too!

✔️ Brush twice daily
✔️ Floss to clean between the lines
✔️ Don’t skip regular dental checkups

Small habits = Big protection 💪
Healthy gums, healthy heart, healthier you! 💖

Day 5

Q. Does screen time before bed interfere with sleep?

A. Yes! Research has demonstrated that screen time leads to sleep interference. 

The bright lights of the screen carry blue light wavelengths which effects sleep hormone melatonin. Avoiding digital screens and bright lights 30 minutes to an hour before going to bed will help body produce better melatonin naturally. This way you can sleep seamlessly!

Day 6

☕ Busting Caffeine Myths: What You Really Need to Know

🔸 Myth: Caffeine is highly addictive.
✅ Truth: It can lead to slight dependence, but unlike alcohol or drugs, it is only mildly addictive. Most people can cut back or quit with only minor, short-lived symptoms.

🔸 Myth: It helps you sober up.
✅ Truth: Caffeine won’t lessen the effects of alcohol. It might make you feel more alert, but you’ll remain dull.

🔸 Myth: Caffeine dehydrates you.
✅ Truth: Although it’s a mild diuretic, your body keeps most of the fluid from coffee or tea, so it won’t significantly dehydrate you if you’re drinking enough water.

🔸 Myth: It stunts your growth.
✅ Truth: There is no evidence for this claim. Consuming caffeine in moderation is believed not to impact height or bone growth.

Now go ahead and enjoy that cup of coffee with confidence.

Day 11

“Will cracking your knuckles give you arthritis?”

Not true! There’s no scientific evidence linking habitual knuckle cracking to arthritis. That satisfying pop is just gas bubbles in the joint fluid collapsing—not damage to your bones or cartilage.

However, frequent or aggressive knuckle cracking can sometimes cause temporary swelling, reduced grip strength, or irritation in nearby soft tissues. If you feel pain or notice changes in movement, it’s always a good idea to check with a healthcare professional.

P.S: You can crack your knuckles without worrying about arthritis, but it’s smart to do it gently and not make it a compulsive habit to keep your hands feeling their best.

Day 12

Pull one gray, get ten more!

Each hair follicle produces just one strand of hair and it works independently. So when you pluck out a gray hair, you're only removing that specific strand. It doesn't trigger a chain reaction or cause nearby hairs to turn gray. Those other follicles have their own schedule, largely driven by genetics.

This myth likely came from people noticing more grays around the same time they started plucking. But the truth is, those new grays would’ve appeared anyway, plucking or not.

So, what does that really mean for your hair?

What can happen with frequent plucking, though, is damage to the hair follicle. Constant pulling can weaken it, and over time, it might stop growing hair altogether. Instead of waging war with tweezers, it’s smarter to explore safer options like coloring, root concealers, or even embracing your natural silver strands.

Gray hair isn’t something to fear. It reflects your journey, character, and confidence. You can’t stop the clock, but you can absolutely decide how you want to wear the years that show.
