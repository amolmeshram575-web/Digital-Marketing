Day 1
🥶 Cold Water After Meals Slows Digestion? Let’s Break the Ice.
Imagine your stomach as a busy kitchen. 🍽️
Chefs (aka digestive enzymes) are working at full speed, fire blazing, breaking down that biryani you just ate.

Now suddenly-----BOOM! ❄️
You pour a glass of ice-cold water over the scene.

The flames sizzle.
The kitchen slows down.
Chefs pause, shiver a little, then reluctantly get back to work. 😅

That’s kind of what happens when you drink cold water immediately after meals.
